#MachineLearning
This repository aims at recording the author's learning process in ML. It consits of 4 subfolders, which stand for differtent learning stages from beginning stage to advanced stage. Each stages contains a README file to illustrate the requisite mathematical knowledge and some network models which are built in codes.
| stage | mathematical knowledge | network models|
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|beginning | |Linear regression, logistic regression, kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), k-means, decision tree, neural networks (MLP/CNN/LSTM), backpropagation, RL (reinforcement learning) with bandit/MDP (Markov Decision Process)/dynamic programming/TD (Temporal Difference)/MC (Monte Carlo).|
|primitive|  |Bayesian linear regression, logistic regression, Transformer/BERT/GPT for NLP, GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model)/HMM (Hidden Markov Model), EM (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm, Baum-Welch algorithm, Viterbi algorithm, Kalman filter, probabilistic graphical models and backpropagation (BP), junction tree algorithm, SVM (Support Vector Machine)/kernel methods/RKHS (Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space), model-based reinforcement learning (RL), policy gradient, actor-critic.｜
